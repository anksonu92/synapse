### Pre-Commit Hooks

Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in the Terraform code such as missing parentheses, and to enforce consistent Terraform styling and spacing. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks.

#### Pre-Commit Installation

Before you can run hooks, you need to have the pre-commit package manager installed.

Using pip:

```
pip install pre-commit
```

Non-administrative installation:

to upgrade: run again, to uninstall: pass uninstall to python
does not work on platforms without symlink support (windows)

```
curl https://pre-commit.com/install-local.py | python -
```

Afterward, `pre-commit --version` should show you what version you're using.

#### Pre-Commit Configuration

The pre-commit config for this repo may be found in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, the contents of which takes the following form:

Run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts:

```
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now pre-commit will run automatically on git commit
